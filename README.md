## Portfolio created using `three.js`
This portfolio website was created using `React`, has a project list in which all the projects are displayed with it's pertaining `github` link and if so, website. Also, added my tictactoe game to it, in case you get bored or you can `hide` or `show` the scene i made with `three.js`with the buttons located in the `navigation bar`.

### `Technologies used`:
`React.js`<br /> `three.js`<br />`tween.js`<br />I omitted the fontAwesome folder, so if you want to make something similar or run it locally you need to download the fontAwesome folder or add it to the html. 

### `npm run start`
Runs the app.
